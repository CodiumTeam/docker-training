# Exercise 8: Clean up the system

In these exercises we will see how to free space and check what specific Docker resources are using that space.

## Delete resources

You can practice deleting types of resources generated by all the previous exercises. By default, you should only delete unused resources:

- Remove all stopped containers
  ```bash
  docker container prune
  ```
- Remove unused images
  ```bash
  docker image prune
  ```
- Remove all unused local volumes
  ```bash
  docker volume prune
  ```
- Remove all unused networks
  ```bash
  docker network prune
  ```
- Remove all unused data (i.e. all unused containers, networks, images and optionally, volumes)
  ```bash
  docker system prune -a
  ```
- If you just want to focus on the resources managed by a specific docker-compose, you can stop and remove all containers, networks, images and volumes like this:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes
  ```

## Show Docker disk usage

Eventually you might see a `running out of disk space` error message.

- In order to fix it, you can just go with the nuke option and delete everything or take a look and see what specifically is taking so much space:
  ```bash
  docker system df
  ```
  The information shown under the column `RECLAIMABLE` is the space consumed by "unused" resources, so that would be recuperable in case you deleted unused resources.
- You could get more detailed information about the specific resources:
  ```bash
  docker system df -v
  ```
